------------THIS FOLDER CONTAINS---------------
	-SignLanguageProject.ipynb
	-MP5_Data: this file contains all the training and testing examples for "Sign Language Recognition"
	-projsen.h5: this file contains the weights that were calculated using the LSTM architecture 
	-Real Time Result.mp4: this contains a real time screen recording of the result

------------HOW TO RUN THE CODE---------------

Every cell that has the comment #RUN and the sequence mentioned should be run as it is.
On the other hand, every cell that #OPTIONAL is not necessary for verifying the model. 
The cells that have #OPTIONAL written on it were the constructors used to make the model.
So, it is not necessary for running the #OPTIONAL but if someone want to train a new gesture model
from scratch then optional part is also necessary for modelling. 

This folder also contains a video file that has the screen-recording of how the model works in real-time.
